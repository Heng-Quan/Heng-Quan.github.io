# About Me

<img src="https://heng-quan.github.io/quanheng.jpg" class="floatpic" width="640" height="520">

I am a graduate student in [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) program](https://aos.princeton.edu) at Princeton University. I'm advised by Professor [Stephan Fueglistaler](https://fueglistaler.princeton.edu), and now I'm working on **tropical atmospheric dynamics** and **SST pattern effect**. I got my bachelor's degree in atmospheric sciences at Peking University (China) in June 2022. Here is [my CV](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/Heng_Quan_CV.pdf).

## Education

- **Sep 2022 - June 2027 (expected):** Princeton University, PhD in atmospheric and oceanic sciences
- **Sep 2018 - June 2022:** Peking University School of Physics, Bachelor's degree in atmospheric sciences

## Researches

- **Tropical dynamics and SST pattern effect:** This is my current graduate research.
- **Reinforcement Learning for Geoengineering:** This is my bachelor thesis research, advised by Professor [Daniel Koll](https://danielkoll.github.io) at Peking University. I also received lots of help from Professor [Nicholas Lutsko](https://nicklutsko.github.io) at UCSD and Dr. [Janni Yuval](https://yaniyuval.wixsite.com/janniy) at MIT.
- **Conditional mean temperature tendency decomposition:** This is my 2021 summer research, advised by Professor [Marianna Linz](https://eps.harvard.edu/people/marinna-katherine-linz) at Harvard University and Professor [Gang Chen](http://gchenpu.com) at UCLA.
- **Asymmetry of temperature series:** This is my undergraduate research in 2021, advised by Professor [Zuntao Fu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zuntao-Fu) at Peking University.
