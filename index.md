Here is **Heng Quan (权衡)**.

I am a graduate student in [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) program](https://aos.princeton.edu) at Princeton University. I'm advised by Professor [Stephan Fueglistaler](https://fueglistaler.princeton.edu), and now I'm working on **tropical atmospheric dynamics** and **SST pattern effect**. I got my bachelor's degree in atmospheric sciences at Peking University (China) in June 2022. Here is [my CV](https://caihanlin.com/file/CV-HanlinCAI.pdf).
