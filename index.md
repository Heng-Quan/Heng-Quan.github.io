# About Me

<img src="https://heng-quan.github.io/quanheng.jpg" class="floatpic" width="960" height="780">

I am a graduate student in [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) program](https://aos.princeton.edu) at Princeton University. I'm advised by Professor [Stephan Fueglistaler](https://fueglistaler.princeton.edu), and now I'm working on **tropical atmospheric dynamics** and **SST pattern effect**. I got my bachelor's degree in atmospheric sciences at Peking University (China) in June 2022. Here is [my CV](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/Heng_Quan_CV.pdf).

## News and Updates

- **Aug 2024：**Our paper ["Non-linear radiative response to patterned global warming due to convection aggregation and non-linear tropical dynamics"](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/aop/JCLI-D-23-0539.1/JCLI-D-23-0539.1.xml) is out in Journal of Climate.
- **July 2024：**I attended the 2024 RossbyPalooza summer school in UChicago. I worked with professor [Da Yang](https://www.yang-climate-group.org) on 'How does water vapor buoyancy contribute to large-scale circulation'. This is a very rewarding experience!
- **June 2024：**I attended 2024 AOFD in Burlington, and gave an oral presentation titled 'Weaker temperature gradient
in a warmer climate'. The [preprint](https://heng-quan.github.io/mypaper/Quan_2024_JAS_preprint.pdf), [slides](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/AOFD2024_Quan_slides.pdf) and [pre-recorded video](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/AOFD2024_Quan_video.mp4) are attached.
- **June 2024：**I attended 2024 CFMIP in Boston, and gave an oral presentation titled 'The SST pattern effect on OLR: the role of large-scale convective aggregation'. The [slides](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/CFMIP2024_Quan_slides.pdf) and [pre-recorded video](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/CFMIP2024_Quan_video.mp4) are attached.
- **Dec 2023：**I attended 2023 AGU in San Francisco, and had two oral presentations about my SST pattern effect and Green's Functions research (in large-scale dynamics session and climate sensitivity session). The [slides](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/AGU2023_Quan_slides.pptx) and [pre-recorded video](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/AGU2023_Quan_video.mp4).
- **Aug 2023：**I had a field trip in Durango, Colorado, with my classmates in AOS program. We launched weather balloons to detect vertical profiles. This is a funny trip!
- **July 2023：**I attended 2023 Gordon Research Conference about Radiation and Climate in Maine, and presented the same [poster](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/CFMIP2023_Quan_poster.pdf) as CFMIP.
- **July 2023：**I attended CFMIP-GASS 2023 meeting in Paris and presented a poster ["Non-linear radiative response to patterned global warming due to convection aggregation"](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/CFMIP2023_Quan_poster.pdf).
- **Apr 2023：**My 2021 summer research paper ["How Do Different Processes Shape Temperature Probability Distributions?
A Percentile-Averaged Temperature Tendency Decomposition"](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/36/15/JCLI-D-22-0556.1.xml) is out in Journal of Climate.
- **Sep 2022：**I started my PhD at Princeton University.
- **June 2022：**I graduated from Peking University.
