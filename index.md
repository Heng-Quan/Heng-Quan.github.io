# About Me

<img src="https://heng-quan.github.io/headshot_WHOI.jpg" class="floatpic" width="960" height="960">

I am a graduate student in [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) program](https://aos.princeton.edu) at Princeton University. I'm advised by Professor [Stephan Fueglistaler](https://fueglistaler.princeton.edu), and now I'm working on **tropical atmospheric dynamics** and **SST pattern effect**. I got my bachelor's degree in atmospheric sciences at Peking University (China) in June 2022. Here is [my CV](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/Heng_Quan_CV.pdf).

## News and Updates
- **Dec 2025：**I attended 2025 AGU in New Orleans, and gave an oral presentation titled 'Periodic extreme rainfall in a warmer climate due to stronger convectively-coupled waves'. The [slides](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/AGU2025_A12_Quan_slides.pptx) and [pre-recorded video](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/AGU2025_A12_Quan_video.mp4) are attached.
- **Dec 2025：**Our paper ["Solar Geoengineering Strategies Based on Reinforcement Learning"](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2025JD044319) is out in JGR Atmospheres. This was my bachelor thesis research that I started in 2021 at Peking University. This paper was rejected for 7 times in 4 years, and I'm very glad to have it successfully published before I finish my PhD.
- **Aug 2025：**I attended the 2025 GFD summer school at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) as a fellow. I worked with [Loren Matilsky](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2AEoS0UAAAAJ&hl=en), [Adrian Van Kan](https://adrianvankan.github.io), [Geoffrey Vallis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=m8IP4nQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [Wanying Kang](https://wanyingkang.com) and [Glenn Flierl](https://eaps.mit.edu/people/faculty/glenn-r-flierl/) on 'Tilted Rossby Waves VS. Potential Vorticity Mixing: Which Determines the Equatorial Jet Direction on Jupiter?'. This is my first time studying atmospheric dynamics on another planet, and I learnt a lot during the 10-week project.
- **June 2025：**Our paper ["The Sea Surface Temperature Pattern Effect on Outgoing Longwave Radiation: The Role of Large-Scale Convective Aggregation"](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL112756) is out in Geophysical Research Letters.
- **Mar 2025：**I'm named a [2025 GFD Fellow](https://gfd.whoi.edu/gfd-fellowships/) at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). I'm looking forward to doing exciting research this summer!  
- **Dec 2024：**I attended 2024 AGU in Washington D.C., and gave an oral presentation titled 'Weakening of tropical free tropospheric temperature gradients with global warming'. The [slides](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/AGU2024_Quan_slides.pptx) and [pre-recorded video](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/AGU2024_Quan_video.mp4) are attached.
- **Dec 2024：**Our paper ["Weakening of tropical free tropospheric temperature gradients with global warming"](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/aop/JAS-D-24-0140.1/JAS-D-24-0140.1.xml) is out in Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences.
- **Oct 2024：**I attended the 2024 ICDM workshop in Nanjing, and gave an oral presentation titled 'Weakening of tropical free tropospheric temperature gradients with global warming'. The [slides](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/ICDM2024_Quan_slides.pptx) are attached. I got the best student oral presentation award! 
- **Aug 2024：**Our paper ["Non-linear radiative response to patterned global warming due to convection aggregation and non-linear tropical dynamics"](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/aop/JCLI-D-23-0539.1/JCLI-D-23-0539.1.xml) is out in Journal of Climate.
- **July 2024：**I attended the 2024 RossbyPalooza summer school in UChicago. I worked with professor [Da Yang](https://www.yang-climate-group.org) on 'How does water vapor buoyancy contribute to large-scale circulation'. This is a very rewarding experience!
- **June 2024：**I attended 2024 AOFD in Burlington, and gave an oral presentation titled 'Weaker temperature gradient
in a warmer climate'. The [slides](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/AOFD2024_Quan_slides.pdf) and [pre-recorded video](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/AOFD2024_Quan_video.mp4) are attached.
- **June 2024：**I attended 2024 CFMIP in Boston, and gave an oral presentation titled 'The SST pattern effect on OLR: the role of large-scale convective aggregation'. The [slides](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/CFMIP2024_Quan_slides.pdf) and [pre-recorded video](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/CFMIP2024_Quan_video.mp4) are attached.
- **Dec 2023：**I attended 2023 AGU in San Francisco, and had two oral presentations about my SST pattern effect and Green's Functions research (in large-scale dynamics session and climate sensitivity session). The [slides](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/AGU2023_Quan_slides.pptx) and [pre-recorded video](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/AGU2023_Quan_video.mp4) are attached.
- **Aug 2023：**I had a field trip in Durango, Colorado, with my classmates in AOS program. We launched weather balloons to detect vertical profiles. This is a funny trip!
- **July 2023：**I attended 2023 Gordon Research Conference about Radiation and Climate in Maine, and presented the same [poster](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/CFMIP2023_Quan_poster.pdf) as CFMIP.
- **July 2023：**I attended CFMIP-GASS 2023 meeting in Paris and presented a poster ["Non-linear radiative response to patterned global warming due to convection aggregation"](https://heng-quan.github.io/file/CFMIP2023_Quan_poster.pdf).
