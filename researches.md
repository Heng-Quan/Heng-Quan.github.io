# Researches

Lastest Update: 16st Aug 2023

## Tropical dynamics and SST pattern effect


## Reinforcement Learning for Geoengineering


## Conditional mean temperature tendency decomposition


## Asymmetry of temperature series
Daily mean temperature series at the mid-latitudes usually have an asymmetric property: They cool rapidly and warm gradually. This research shows that such temperature asymmetry is due to the asymmetry of frequency and intensity between cold and warm fronts: In North China Plain, for example, cold fronts are stronger and more frequent than warm fronts, so daily mean temperature series cools rapidly and warms gradually. This is my undergraduate research in 2021, advised by Professor [Zuntao Fu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zuntao-Fu) at Peking University. The [research paper](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.7338) is published in International Journal of Climatology.
