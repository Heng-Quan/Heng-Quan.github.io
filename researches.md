## Conditional mean temperature tendency decomposition
This research proposes a conditional mean temperature tendency decomposition framework that tells us what processes drive temperature towards or away from extremes at every temperature percentile, which is very useful for extreme events studies. It tells us that horizontal temperature advection drives temperatures toward more extreme values over most land in the midlatitudes, but dampens temperature anomalies in some coastal summer monsoon regions, where extreme temperatures result from other processes. This is my 2021 summer research, advised by Professor [Marianna Linz](https://eps.harvard.edu/people/marinna-katherine-linz) at Harvard University and Professor [Gang Chen](http://gchenpu.com) at UCLA. The [research paper](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/aop/JCLI-D-22-0556.1/JCLI-D-22-0556.1.xml) is published in Journal of Climate.


## Asymmetry of temperature series
Daily mean temperature series at the mid-latitudes usually have an asymmetric property: They cool rapidly and warm gradually. This research shows that such temperature asymmetry is due to the asymmetry of frequency and intensity between cold and warm fronts: In North China Plain, for example, cold fronts are stronger and more frequent than warm fronts, so daily mean temperature series cools rapidly and warms gradually. This is my undergraduate research in 2021, advised by Professor [Zuntao Fu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zuntao-Fu) at Peking University. The [research paper](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.7338) is published in International Journal of Climatology.
