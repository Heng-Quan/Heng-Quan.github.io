## Tropical dynamics and SST pattern effect



## Reinforcement Learning for Geoengineering
One solar geoengineering method is injecting aerosols in the stratosphere to reflect solar radiation. Different strategies (global distribution + time dependence) of aerosol injection will affect climate differently, and people want to find the 'best' strategy that results in a desired climate state. This is an optimization problem and could be solved by reinforcement learning, a machine learning technic widely used in autonomous driving, robotics and AI game playing. This research shows that reinforcement learning gives us effective geoengineering strategies that can prevent global warming and revert climate change. This is my bachelor thesis research, advised by Professor [Daniel Koll](https://danielkoll.github.io) at Peking University. I also received lots of help from Professor [Nicholas Lutsko](https://nicklutsko.github.io) at UCSD and Dr. [Janni Yuval](https://yaniyuval.wixsite.com/janniy) at MIT. The research paper is going to be submitted soon.


## Conditional mean temperature tendency decomposition
This research proposes a conditional mean temperature tendency decomposition framework that tells us what processes drive temperature towards or away from extremes at every temperature percentile, which is very useful for extreme events studies. It tells us that horizontal temperature advection drives temperatures toward more extreme values over most land in the midlatitudes, but dampens temperature anomalies in some coastal summer monsoon regions, where extreme temperatures result from other processes. This is my 2021 summer research, advised by Professor [Marianna Linz](https://eps.harvard.edu/people/marinna-katherine-linz) at Harvard University and Professor [Gang Chen](http://gchenpu.com) at UCLA. The [research paper](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/aop/JCLI-D-22-0556.1/JCLI-D-22-0556.1.xml) is published in Journal of Climate.


## Asymmetry of temperature series
Daily mean temperature series at the mid-latitudes usually have an asymmetric property: They cool rapidly and warm gradually. This research shows that such temperature asymmetry is due to the asymmetry of frequency and intensity between cold and warm fronts: In North China Plain, for example, cold fronts are stronger and more frequent than warm fronts, so daily mean temperature series cools rapidly and warms gradually. This is my undergraduate research in 2021, advised by Professor [Zuntao Fu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zuntao-Fu) at Peking University. The [research paper](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.7338) is published in International Journal of Climatology.
